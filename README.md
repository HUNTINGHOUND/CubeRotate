#  CubeRotate
A simple program that project a 3d cube and allows you to rotate it.

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#General_rotations for general rotation.

## Input

After compiling the program you can tell it how many degrees to rotate and the smoothness of the rotation in the form of `[roll] [pitch] [yaw] [smooth]`. Smooth determines how many iterations before the cube reach the desired state, smaller the number, more rough the animation is.
